    <h2>Um!</h2>
    <p>
      I stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/gaphodil">Twitch</a> sometimes.
      Most often it'll be <a href="https://delicious-fruit.com">semi-obscure fangames</a>
      of an <a href="https://iwbtg.kayin.moe">infamous platformer</a>.
      Also I use a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HBWl9VI.png">VTuber model</a>.

      The games I play on my own time are pretty eclectic in genre and popularity,
      though usually tend towards indie. I have a habit of achievement hunting (not to the
      point of obsession, thankfully), and while I appreciate casual sim stuff, I also enjoy
      <a href="https://cedb.me/">a bit of challenge</a>, though I usually shy away
      from anything that's <i>really</i> hard.
