        I'll be honest: this game isn't great. The speedrun, though? It's hilarious.
        Most skips revolve around a specific armour-type granting increased movement speed
        and jump height, except the latter had an oversight on ledges of a very specific incline,
        bringing forth a brand new fictional "space program". I'd never go back to do runs,
        but the brief community that formed around this one was especially great.
