        I <i>love</i> this game. There's only one "correct" route, but it was
        still fun to devise, as well as writing outright solutions to the puzzles. The platforming
        itself flows super cleanly without being too difficult, and mixing it with short bursts of
        rapid-fire directional inputs was extremely my speed. I was satisfied with a sub-10 minute time,
        and I'm so glad that I'm no longer the only one who has such a time.
