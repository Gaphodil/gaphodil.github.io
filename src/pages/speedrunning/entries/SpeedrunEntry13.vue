        I'm deeply fond of this game. A lot of collaboration in terms of routing and strat-finding,
        including with the developer, who was kind enough to add tweaks and shift things around to
        keep the run flowing in an interesting way. I even raced it during
        <a href="https://youtu.be/OHI5-6Io2qg">Fangame Marathon 2023</a>

        The game's casual experience also provides an incredible sense of exploration with its secrets.
