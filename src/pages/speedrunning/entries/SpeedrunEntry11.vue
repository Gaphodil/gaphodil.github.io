        This was the only game from FAST I enjoyed enough to do additional runs of,
        with the numerous but small skips and strategies, and the polished gameplay,
        though part of the reason was that there were so many games that could be
        practiced that no single one could have been focused on. (Fortunately the
        <a href="https://discord.gg/X26VSNHGEV">upcoming second iteration</a> in early 2024
        will have a new format.)
