        I decided to start experimenting with some IWBTG fangame ideas I'd had,
        and since they weren't easily feasible to implement outside of Godot, I started
        with the most complete community engine currently available. As I learned more
        about GDScript over the course of the month, I started implementing non-specific
        changes that I felt could be immediately useful to others, and so created a fork to
        mirror my additions without needing to open-source my own project before it's ready
        for release. The largest addition was the overhaul to the in-game settings system,
        with algorithmic menu generation and an API to simplify the getting and, well,
        "setting" of settings, as well as the saving and loading.
