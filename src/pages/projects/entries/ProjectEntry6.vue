        This was a small project for the annual I Wanna Community Secret Santa event,
        taking place from December 1st to Christmas Eve. My recipient requested something
        somewhat easy in the trap or troll genre, so I tried my best despite my unfamiliarity.
        It's slightly absurd in its humour, and very short!
